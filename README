# Tetris Desktop Game

A fully functional Tetris game built with Go backend and JavaScript frontend, packaged as a standalone Windows desktop application using Wails.

## How to play Quick Start!

On the https://github.com/Ottowski/GoLang-Tetris page, click the green button "<> code", which will allow you to see several download options, but I recommend the "DOWNLOAD ZIP" file option.

After downloading the zip file, open it and place the folder "GoLang-Tetris-main" inside of the zip file, on your desktop. 

Then you open the folder "GoLang-Tetris-main", there you will see the "tetris-desktop.exe" file furthest down in the folder.

Finally simply double-click "tetris-desktop.exe" in the project root folder to launch the game!

wails build
Copy-Item "build\bin\tetris-desktop.exe" "..\tetris-desktop.exe" -Force
```
